ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Campaigns in certain categories (e.g., games, design, technology) have higher success rates.

Funding goals directly affect success probability â€” very high goals tend to fail more often.

Most successful campaigns reach their goal within the first half of their duration.

Seasonal trends affect funding â€” campaigns launched in Q2 and Q3 see better performance.
